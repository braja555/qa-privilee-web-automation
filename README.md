### Automated Test Scenarios

Detailed test cases for Menu(including all venus), SignUp, Filter, Map Search functionalities have been written to cover maximum possible scenarios. This ensures comprehensive coverage and helps identify candidates for automation. 

#### SignUp:
TS_01_SignUp: Validate signup and membership payment process for one adult user.

TS_02_SignUp: Validate signup and membership payment process for two adult users

TS_03_SignUp: Validate signup and membership payment process for two adults and children.

TS_04_SignUp: Validate signup and membership payment process for two adults with monthly payment option

#### Menu:
TS_01_Menu: Validate that each menu on the application correctly displays the names of all venues associated with it

TS_02_Menu: Validate the correct functionality of menus and the accurate count of venues

TS_03_Menu: Validate the pool and beach page of all images

#### Filter:
TS_01_Filter: Validate the venue by applying filters and it's api returned results on venue list page

TS_02_Filter: Validate the venue by passing the categories data to the endpoint and to the FE (applying the categories through Filters

TS_03_Filter: Validate the clear filter functionality

#### Search:
TS_01_Search: Validate venue search functionality for guest users on the application.

TS_02_Search: Validate venue search functionality by giving user detail on the application.
